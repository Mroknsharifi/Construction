        review : "job. They discussed the plan and process before beginning work on the property and patiently answered any questions we had for them. Once the project began, they consistently provided ongoing updates and any changes to schedule or the scope of work due to unforeseen circumstances or events (i.e., weather delays or issues with layout or work).They completed the project on time and my family, and I couldn’t be happier with their work. MTM’s work is carried out with the highest possible"

        review : "actually disappointed that it took that long, his plan was to get it done in two but the winter storm caused a one week delay. One thing that really stood out was how he is such a perfectionist, he will spend hours redoing something if he's not happy with it, even if you're fine with it. Working with Mohammad and his team was the best decision we made. Their quote was very reasonable compared to others. I've been recommending them to friends and family. A month after we moved in, we reached out to him and his team to ask about something"

He and his crew did an amazing job and I have full trust in his ability to complete any job he is hired for! I’m sure I will be using him again at some time with another project. Thanks Mohammed !"

        review : "new fence as ours unfortunately had fallen over due to heavy wind storms recently.He was very respectful and kind during the entire process as well as his crew. His price could not be beaten as well as the quality and workmanship exceed our expectations! They began drilling holes and setting posts immediately and within a couple of days our fence was completed. We would highly recommend Mohammed and his crew at MTM General Contracting to all of our friends and familyThank you for the amazing jo"

        review : "job they were doing, the project then expanded into a back patio and front patio with the same interlocking stones to match the look I am so happy and impressed with the final look and quality of all the interlocking. It’s really modernized the house and the walkway is better than I even imagined it can be. Mo was extremely professional throughout the process providing digital design drawings, estimates and communicating daily when he was here on the job. He made great recommendations about what materials to use, as well as design and building recommendations. He is the real deal! The top notch reliable and professional contractor you are looking for on your project. Don’t hesitate to hire this guy"
